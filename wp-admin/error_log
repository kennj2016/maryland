This site offers legal information, not legal advice. We make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information and to clearly explain your options. However we do not provide legal advice - the application of the law to your individual circumstances. For legal advice, you should consult an attorney.</p><p>2.Can the Tenant appeal a decision? Either tenant or landlord may appeal the judgment. The appeal must be made within two days of the date of judgment, and if the tenant wants to delay execution of the judgment he must post a bond.</p><p>3. Can I just move out my tenants belongings out of the house since he/she owes me money?  A landlord who moves a tenant's belongings out of the home, changes the locks, or cuts off utilities without a court order may be criminally prosecuted and liable for damages. For more info on this question <a href=|gq2|http://marylandevictionsonline.com/Info/Illegal_Eviction_Info.html|gq2|>click here</a>.</p><p>4. What happens on the day of eviction? On the date of an eviction, the sheriff will come to the rental unit to order the tenant and everyone inside to leave. The landlord can then remove all property from the unit and put it on the public right-of-way while the sheriff supervises. Once the property is moved from the unit, it is the tenant's responsibility. Some HOAs may hold the landlord responsible for the trash removal after 24/hours. </p><p>5. What is a Rent Court Agent? A Rent Court Agent files and appears in rent court for the landlord. We are Rent Court Agents in Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Calvert County, Frederick County, Harford County, Howard County, Charles County, Anne Arundel, Prince Georges County and Montgomery County.</p><p>6. I received a money judgment that was entered against the tenant , what is it? <br />The money judgment will usually be on the tenant's credit for ten years and can be renewed thereafter for a small fee for another ten years. Soon after a case is filed, the tenant will usually have an unlawful detainer/eviction showing on their credit. If a money judgment is entered for the eviction, the judgment will usually appear on their credit. The money judgment is needed for any form of collections, whether it is through a collection agency or by way of a wage garnishment or bank levy.</p><p>7. The utilities are in my name but the tenant is supposed to pay them and they are past due, can I shut them off? Or the utilities are in my name, and I've paid them all along but since they aren't paying me why should I pay the utilities? <br />No! You cannot turn the utilities off. Even if the utilities are past due and they aren't paying you, you cannot stop paying them or have them turned off. Doing so will only cause you more problems in the end. These actions can be construed as retaliatory towards the tenant, especially during an eviction. Turning off the utilities could also stop the eviction entirely. </p><p>8. Can a Tenant Be Evicted Because of Unpaid Rent? Tenants should try to work out a schedule of payments with landlord; the Dept. of Social Services may help. In most cases the tenant cannot be evicted if the amount the court decided was due, plus court costs, is paid prior to the eviction. Payment to the landlord must be in cash, certified check or money order. Exceptions: If a tenant has had three judgments of possession (four in Baltimore City) filed against him/her during the 12 months before the current suit, a landlord may request that the court deny the tenant’s right to redeem the property. The landlord must provide the court with a list of prior case numbers and judgment dates. If the judge grants the request, the tenant may be evicted even if he/she pays the rent due.</p><p>9. Why do you charge surcharges for certain counties? We have offices in Prince George's County and Baltimore City. We can process evictions for several other jurisdictions, but we have to take into consideration travel time to the courts and volume of cases. If you see an |gq2|*|gq2| next to your county there will be a surcharge applied to you at checkout. </p><p>10. What happens if my tenant files for Bankruptcy? We have experience dealing with tenants that have filed for Bankruptcy protection while still in a lease. Please contact us so we can review your options. For more information about the process for handling the Bankruptcy as of Creditor/Landlord visist the US Bankruptcy web page at : <a href=|gq2|http://www.mdb.uscourts.gov/PS_creditors.aspx|gq2|>http://www.mdb.uscourts.gov/PS_creditors.aspx</a></p><p>11. Do I have to pay interest on t my tenant security deposit? Yes, generally tenants in Maryland are entitled to interest on their security deposits. If the deposit is more then $50, and held for more that 6/months. The interest currently required on security deposits is 3% per annum http://www.peoples-law.org/node/236 <a href=|gq2|http://www.mdjustice.org/files/MLASecurityDeposit.pdf|gq2|>http://www.mdjustice.org/files/MLASecurityDeposit.pdf</a>  </p><p>12. We are a large apartment complex, do have bulk pricing for eviction? Yes, for apartment complexes or property management firms, please call for bulk pricing.</p><p>13. What does |gq2|affected property under 6-801|gq2| mean? A property constructed before 1950 that conains at least once rental dwelling unit; For more information <a href=|gq2|http://mlis.state.md.us/asp/web_statutes.asp?gen&amp;6-801|gq2|>click here</a>. </p><p>14. My house is in foreclosure, does my tenant still owe me the monthly rent? Yes, Maryland law requires that a tenant pays rent to the owner until there is a new owner or until the banks takes back the home.

This affords the advantage to you of our signature performance of professional services  with regard to maximum efficiency and economy. We make owning investment property the hassle-free and financially profitable venture that it should be ideally! Let us show you how we can manage and maximize the financial potential of your investment property and, thus, liberate your time and energy to conquer new horizons!</p><p><br />By joining us you are getting a complete property management company. Office hours are Monday through Saturday with round-the-clock response for emergencies! Our clients, as well as our tenants, are guaranteed a timely and satisfactory response to inquiries or issues. It also gives you the peace of mind that your investment property is, as promised, being managed responsibly and professionally. As a client, you will also receive the following services: <br /><br /><strong>Rental Budget:</strong><br />We determine a rental budget and a fair market rent rate for your property. The studies we compile include mortgage payments, maintenance, and management costs.<br /><br /><strong>Advertising:</strong><br />We will write and insert a classified ad in the newspaper, with governement programs (Section 8 listings) as well as on the internet mentioning the details which will most effectively entice a prospective renter. When the property is rented, we handle the cancellation of the ads as well.  “For Rent” signage is placed and removed at your rental property. Open houses are conducted as needed.<br /><br /><strong>Tenant Screening:</strong><br />We will thoroughly screen all replies to your property. We screen tenants by credit report, employment  and income verification, and we interview the last landlord to verify that this prospective tenant was a satisfactory  tenant and left their last rental property in good standing. Yes, we screen our prospective tenants very hard, but it is as important to MEO as it is to you that we place good people into your investment property. The early personal contact that a tenant receives from MEO establishes a good dependable relationship.<br /><br /><strong>Maintenance:</strong><br />We will answer the renter’s maintenance complaints and arrange for repair work. Our tenants have access to a 24-hour emergency number if a problem should arise in the middle of the night. This adds security to the tenant as well as you the investor that we are watching after your property 24 hours a day 7 days a week. That is comforting all by itself.<br /><br /><strong>Inspections:</strong><br />When a tenant checks into a property we conduct a walk through inspection on that property. This way we have on record the condition that the property was in when a tenant moves in. When that tenant leaves we use the same report to check them out. This way there is no confusion on the condition of the property after a tenant leaves. Our property managers  also conduct annual internal inspections and quarterly “drive by” inspections on your property to make sure that the tenant is taking the best care of your rental investment.<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Statements:</strong><br />Each month you will receive a detailed statement on your property. These statements are easy to read and understand. The statement will break down the month’s activity on your investment property. It will show rent collected, management fees deducted, itemized maintenance, and finally your net dollar amount. <br /><br />Every real-estate investor knows two things: 1) Owning rental property is good business with great returns. 2) It can also cause you a ton of grief. Owning rental property should be an enjoyable venture. Why not let a professional management company help you make owning rental properties a trouble free investment. By joining MEO that is exactly what you will get. We make owning rental property fun as well as lucrative. Let us help you today.</p>","margin-bottom":"100px"}}],"option":{},"size":"1/1"}]' WHERE meta_id = 1706 made by require_once('wp-admin/admin.php'), do_action('tools_page_velvet-blues-update-urls'), WP_Hook->do_action, WP_Hook->apply_filters, call_user_func_array, VelvetBluesUU_management_page, VB_update_urls

Two classes of Rental Facility Licenses exist, depending upon the structure type of the rental property:<br /><br />Applications:<br /><br />Rental Housing Licensing Application<br /><br />The obligation to License rests with the owner of the property. The licensing requirements DO NOT APPLY to properties located within the city limits of certain incorporated municipalities.  Owners of property located within incorporated municipalities should also contact local city governments to inquire about municipal licensing requirements.<br /><br />Note - Room Rentals: - An owner occupying his/her home is not required to obtain a rental facility license.<br /><br /><strong>What's the Process?</strong><br /><br />The licensing process is performed by the Licensing and Registration unit of the Department of Housing and Community Affairs. The process includes completion of a Rental Facility License Application and payment of an annual license fee. Once a property owner is licensed, the Department automatically generates a renewal notice each year. The license fee year runs from each July 1st through the following June 30.<br /><br />What are the New Requirements regarding Lead Based Paint ?<br /><br />Effective October 1, 2004, the Montgomery County Department of Housing and Community Affairs (DHCA) is compelled by legislation enacted by the Maryland General Assembly to require that owners of rental properties built prior to January 1, 1950 demonstrate full compliance with the requirements of the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) Lead Poisoning Prevention Program when issuing a Rental Facility License. <br /><br />The Rental Facility License Application for all rental types now requires acknowledgement of the date built. If the property was built before January 1, 1950, proof of current registration with the MDE Lead Poisoning Prevention Program; and proof that an accredited inspector has certified that the property meets one of the required inspection standards (lead-free certificate, limited lead-free certificate, or a full risk reduction certificate) must be submitted.<br /><br />For further information regarding the Maryland Department of the Environment’s Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, contact the MDE at 1-800-776-2706 or visit the MDE website at www.MDE.state.md.us.<br />Are there penalties for failure to obtain a License?<br /><br />Any person who operates a rental property without first having obtained a License is subject to a class A violation and may have to pay civil fines as a penalty.<br /><br />For current fee amounts and further information, refer to Frequently Asked Licensing/Registration Questions or contact the Licensing and Registration unit at 240-777-3666.<br /><br />Frequently Asked Licensing/Registration Questions<br /><br />Effective July 1, 2004<br /><br />1. How Much are the License/Registration Fees?<br /><br />Structure Type Annual Fee Per Unit for Each Structure Type<br /><strong>LICENSE FEES</strong><br /><span class=|gq2|style3|gq2|>CLASS I </span>Licenses Apartment Complex $38.00<br />Accessory Apartment $38.00<br />Personal Living Quarters $38.00<br />All Other<br />(includes individually owned Garden Condominium, High-Rise Condominium, and Piggy-Back Units) $56.00<br /><br /><span class=|gq2|style3|gq2|>CLASS II </span>Licenses Single Family Detached House $98.00<br />Townhouse $98.00<br />Duplex $98.00<br />Back to Back Townhouse $98.00<br />Quadraplex $98.00<br /><br /><strong>REGISTRATION FEES</strong><br />Common Ownership Communities Registration Fees All types of units $3.00<br />Registered Living Units No fee<br /><br />2. How often do I have to pay the License/registration fee?<br /><br />The License/registration year period follows the county's fiscal year--July 1st through June 30th of each year. The full fee is due for any unit that is rented for any portion of the fiscal year.<br /><br />3. How do I know when the License/registration fee is due?<br /><br />Invoices are automatically issued each year. Payment is due within 30 days upon receipt.<br /><br />4. Who do I make my check payable to?<br /><br />Montgomery County, MD.<br /><br />5. When will I receive my License?<br /><br />License Certificates are only issued to landlords of apartment complexes (because the certificate must be posted). For all others, the canceled check acts as confirmation that the application has been processed. Anyone needing confirmation or written proof of licensing status may contact the licensing unit directly by calling 240-777-3666.<br /><br />6. Who must complete the License application form?<br /><br />Anyone may complete the form, but the owner must sign the completed application.<br /><br />7. What are the penalties for failing to License/register?<br /><br />Failure to License/register is a Class A Violation of the Montgomery County Code and violators may be issued a civil citation for $500 for the initial offense, and $750 for repeat offenses.<br /><br />8. Do I have to hire an agent or management company to handle my rental property?<br /><br />No, however rental property owners who live outside the state of Maryland must designate an |gq2|agent for service of process|gq2| (also called a |gq2|legal agent|gq2|). The legal agent must live in Maryland and agree to accept legal documents on behalf of the out-of-state owner. A legal agent may be a friend or family member, they do not have to be a professional management agent. Even owners living in nearby Washington, D.C. or Virginia must assign legal agents.<br /><br />9. What do I do if I sell my rental property? Do I get a refund of the License fee?<br /><br />Notify the Licensing/Registration Unit by sending in a short note which includes the following information:<br /><br />- License number<br /><br />- Address of the rental property<br /><br />- Date of the sale<br /><br />- New owner's name &amp; address<br /><br />No refund will be issued if the property was rented during any portion of the License year.<br /><br />10. What does Montgomery County use the License/Registration Fees to pay for?<br /><br />License fees are used to support the landlord-tenant dispute resolution process as well as code enforcement activities.<br /><br />Common ownership community registration fees are used to support the common ownership communities dispute resolution process.<br /><br />11. Do the licensing laws apply in all areas of Montgomery County?<br /><br />No. Rental properties located within the city limits of certain incorporated municipalities may need to be licensed by the respective city governments, such as City of Rockville and the City of Gaithersburg. A phone call to the License and Registration unit will confirm whether licensing/registration is required. Our phone number is 240-777-3666.<br /><br />12. Are any units exempt from the licensing requirements?<br /><br />Yes - there are two types of exemptions:<br /><br />Owner Occupied: A unit may be exempt if someone who is a partial owner lives in the unit - caller should contact the licensing unit for details.<br /><br />Relative Occupied: A unit may be exempt if it is occupied by a relative of the owner. The term |gq2|relative|gq2| means:<br /><br />The landlord's siblings, parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren, and their spouses; and<br /><br />The landlord's spouse and the spouse's siblings, parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren, and their spouses.<br /><br />13. Are there special licensing requirements for Accessory Apartments?<br /><br />There is a separate application process for accessory apartments, commonly referred to as |gq2|mother-in-law|gq2| apartments. These units may only be located in owner-occupied single family detached homes and the property owner must be granted a special exception by the Board of Appeals. Any property owner interested in this program should contact the Housing Code Enforcement unit for details at 240-777-3785.<br /><br />14. What are Registered Living Units?<br /><br />Registered Living units are similar to accessory apartments, except that the units are occupied rent-free by either a relative or household employee of the owner occupant.<br /><br />15. What are Personal Living Quarters?<br /><br />The Personal Living Quarters program allows for the existence of affordable individual living units in a multi-use building. A Personal Living Quarters Building is a building containing at least 6 individual living units where the residents may share cooking and sanitation facilities. Personal Living Quarters are allowed as a special exception or a permitted use in all multiple-family residential zones, central business district zones, transit station development area zones, and certain commercial zones. For additional information, contact the Licensing and Registration unit at 240-777-3666.<br /><br />For more info on Montgomery County Licensing and Registration - <a href=|gq2|http://montgomerycountymd.gov/DHCA/housing/licensing/|gq2|>click here</a><br /><br /><br /></span><hr /><span class=|gq2|style1|gq2|><br />For the Landlord Tenant Handbook for Montgomery County <a href=|gq2|http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/dhca/images/PDF/handbook_web.pdf|gq2|>click here.</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=|gq2|style1|gq2|><br /><br />Important Publications<br /><br />1.  <a href=|gq2|https://marylandevictionsonline.com/MEO%201/PDFs/BaltimoreTenant_Intro_Packet.pdf|gq2|>BNI Publication </a><br /></span></h2><p> </p><hr /><table><tbody><tr><td valign=|gq2|top|gq2| width=|gq2|400px|gq2|>We Provide Eviction Services for Rockville<br />We Provide Eviction Services for Gaithersburg<br />We Provide Eviction Services for Silver Spring<br />We Provide Eviction Services for Montgomery Village <br />We Provide Eviction Services for Wheaton <br />We Provide Eviction Services for Takoma Park<br /> </td><td valign=|gq2|top|gq2|>We Provide Eviction Services for Chevy Chase<br />We Provide Eviction Services for Kensington<br />We Provide Eviction Services for Poolesville<br />We Provide Eviction Services for Glen Echo<br />We Provide Eviction Services for Brookeville<br />We Provide Evictoin Services for Glenmount</td></tr></tbody></table>","margin-bottom":"20px"}}],"option":{},"size":"1/1"}]' WHERE meta_id = 1787 made by require_once('wp-admin/admin.php'), do_action('tools_page_velvet-blues-update-urls'), WP_Hook->do_action, WP_Hook->apply_filters, call_user_func_array, VelvetBluesUU_management_page, VB_update_urls

This site offers legal information, not legal advice. We make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information and to clearly explain your options. However we do not provide legal advice - the application of the law to your individual circumstances. For legal advice, you should consult an attorney.</p><p>2.Can the Tenant appeal a decision? Either tenant or landlord may appeal the judgment. The appeal must be made within two days of the date of judgment, and if the tenant wants to delay execution of the judgment he must post a bond.</p><p>3. Can I just move out my tenants belongings out of the house since he/she owes me money?  A landlord who moves a tenant's belongings out of the home, changes the locks, or cuts off utilities without a court order may be criminally prosecuted and liable for damages. For more info on this question <a href=|gq2|http://marylandevictionsonline.com/Info/Illegal_Eviction_Info.html|gq2|>click here</a>.</p><p>4. What happens on the day of eviction? On the date of an eviction, the sheriff will come to the rental unit to order the tenant and everyone inside to leave. The landlord can then remove all property from the unit and put it on the public right-of-way while the sheriff supervises. Once the property is moved from the unit, it is the tenant's responsibility. Some HOAs may hold the landlord responsible for the trash removal after 24/hours. </p><p>5. What is a Rent Court Agent? A Rent Court Agent files and appears in rent court for the landlord. We are Rent Court Agents in Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Calvert County, Frederick County, Harford County, Howard County, Charles County, Anne Arundel, Prince Georges County and Montgomery County.</p><p>6. I received a money judgment that was entered against the tenant , what is it? <br />The money judgment will usually be on the tenant's credit for ten years and can be renewed thereafter for a small fee for another ten years. Soon after a case is filed, the tenant will usually have an unlawful detainer/eviction showing on their credit. If a money judgment is entered for the eviction, the judgment will usually appear on their credit. The money judgment is needed for any form of collections, whether it is through a collection agency or by way of a wage garnishment or bank levy.</p><p>7. The utilities are in my name but the tenant is supposed to pay them and they are past due, can I shut them off? Or the utilities are in my name, and I've paid them all along but since they aren't paying me why should I pay the utilities? <br />No! You cannot turn the utilities off. Even if the utilities are past due and they aren't paying you, you cannot stop paying them or have them turned off. Doing so will only cause you more problems in the end. These actions can be construed as retaliatory towards the tenant, especially during an eviction. Turning off the utilities could also stop the eviction entirely. </p><p>8. Can a Tenant Be Evicted Because of Unpaid Rent? Tenants should try to work out a schedule of payments with landlord; the Dept. of Social Services may help. In most cases the tenant cannot be evicted if the amount the court decided was due, plus court costs, is paid prior to the eviction. Payment to the landlord must be in cash, certified check or money order. Exceptions: If a tenant has had three judgments of possession (four in Baltimore City) filed against him/her during the 12 months before the current suit, a landlord may request that the court deny the tenant’s right to redeem the property. The landlord must provide the court with a list of prior case numbers and judgment dates. If the judge grants the request, the tenant may be evicted even if he/she pays the rent due.</p><p>9. Why do you charge surcharges for certain counties? We have offices in Prince George's County and Baltimore City. We can process evictions for several other jurisdictions, but we have to take into consideration travel time to the courts and volume of cases. If you see an |gq2|*|gq2| next to your county there will be a surcharge applied to you at checkout. </p><p>10. What happens if my tenant files for Bankruptcy? We have experience dealing with tenants that have filed for Bankruptcy protection while still in a lease. Please contact us so we can review your options. For more information about the process for handling the Bankruptcy as of Creditor/Landlord visist the US Bankruptcy web page at : <a href=|gq2|http://www.mdb.uscourts.gov/PS_creditors.aspx|gq2|>http://www.mdb.uscourts.gov/PS_creditors.aspx</a></p><p>11. Do I have to pay interest on t my tenant security deposit? Yes, generally tenants in Maryland are entitled to interest on their security deposits. If the deposit is more then $50, and held for more that 6/months. The interest currently required on security deposits is 3% per annum http://www.peoples-law.org/node/236 <a href=|gq2|http://www.mdjustice.org/files/MLASecurityDeposit.pdf|gq2|>http://www.mdjustice.org/files/MLASecurityDeposit.pdf</a>  </p><p>12. We are a large apartment complex, do have bulk pricing for eviction? Yes, for apartment complexes or property management firms, please call for bulk pricing.</p><p>13. What does |gq2|affected property under 6-801|gq2| mean? A property constructed before 1950 that conains at least once rental dwelling unit; For more information <a href=|gq2|http://mlis.state.md.us/asp/web_statutes.asp?gen&amp;6-801|gq2|>click here</a>. </p><p>14. My house is in foreclosure, does my tenant still owe me the monthly rent? Yes, Maryland law requires that a tenant pays rent to the owner until there is a new owner or until the banks takes back the home.

Let us show you how we can manage and maximize the financial potential of your investment property and, thus, liberate your time and energy to conquer new horizons!</p><p><br />By joining us you are getting a complete property management company. Office hours are Monday through Saturday with round-the-clock response for emergencies! Our clients, as well as our tenants, are guaranteed a timely and satisfactory response to inquiries or issues. It also gives you the peace of mind that your investment property is, as promised, being managed responsibly and professionally. As a client, you will also receive the following services: <br /><br /><strong>Rental Budget:</strong><br />We determine a rental budget and a fair market rent rate for your property. The studies we compile include mortgage payments, maintenance, and management costs.<br /><br /><strong>Advertising:</strong><br />We will write and insert a classified ad in the newspaper, with governement programs (Section 8 listings) as well as on the internet mentioning the details which will most effectively entice a prospective renter. When the property is rented, we handle the cancellation of the ads as well.  “For Rent” signage is placed and removed at your rental property. Open houses are conducted as needed.<br /><br /><strong>Tenant Screening:</strong><br />We will thoroughly screen all replies to your property. We screen tenants by credit report, employment  and income verification, and we interview the last landlord to verify that this prospective tenant was a satisfactory  tenant and left their last rental property in good standing. Yes, we screen our prospective tenants very hard, but it is as important to MEO as it is to you that we place good people into your investment property. The early personal contact that a tenant receives from MEO establishes a good dependable relationship.<br /><br /><strong>Maintenance:</strong><br />We will answer the renter’s maintenance complaints and arrange for repair work. Our tenants have access to a 24-hour emergency number if a problem should arise in the middle of the night. This adds security to the tenant as well as you the investor that we are watching after your property 24 hours a day 7 days a week. That is comforting all by itself.<br /><br /><strong>Inspections:</strong><br />When a tenant checks into a property we conduct a walk through inspection on that property. This way we have on record the condition that the property was in when a tenant moves in. When that tenant leaves we use the same report to check them out. This way there is no confusion on the condition of the property after a tenant leaves. Our property managers  also conduct annual internal inspections and quarterly “drive by” inspections on your property to make sure that the tenant is taking the best care of your rental investment.<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Statements:</strong><br />Each month you will receive a detailed statement on your property. These statements are easy to read and understand. The statement will break down the month’s activity on your investment property. It will show rent collected, management fees deducted, itemized maintenance, and finally your net dollar amount. <br /><br />Every real-estate investor knows two things: 1) Owning rental property is good business with great returns. 2) It can also cause you a ton of grief. Owning rental property should be an enjoyable venture. Why not let a professional management company help you make owning rental properties a trouble free investment. By joining MEO that is exactly what you will get. We make owning rental property fun as well as lucrative. Let us help you today.</p>","margin-bottom":"100px"}}],"option":{},"size":"1/1"}]' WHERE meta_id = 1706 made by require_once('wp-admin/admin.php'), do_action('tools_page_velvet-blues-update-urls'), WP_Hook->do_action, WP_Hook->apply_filters, call_user_func_array, VelvetBluesUU_management_page, VB_update_urls

Two classes of Rental Facility Licenses exist, depending upon the structure type of the rental property:<br /><br />Applications:<br /><br />Rental Housing Licensing Application<br /><br />The obligation to License rests with the owner of the property. The licensing requirements DO NOT APPLY to properties located within the city limits of certain incorporated municipalities.  Owners of property located within incorporated municipalities should also contact local city governments to inquire about municipal licensing requirements.<br /><br />Note - Room Rentals: - An owner occupying his/her home is not required to obtain a rental facility license.<br /><br /><strong>What's the Process?</strong><br /><br />The licensing process is performed by the Licensing and Registration unit of the Department of Housing and Community Affairs. The process includes completion of a Rental Facility License Application and payment of an annual license fee. Once a property owner is licensed, the Department automatically generates a renewal notice each year. The license fee year runs from each July 1st through the following June 30.<br /><br />What are the New Requirements regarding Lead Based Paint ?<br /><br />Effective October 1, 2004, the Montgomery County Department of Housing and Community Affairs (DHCA) is compelled by legislation enacted by the Maryland General Assembly to require that owners of rental properties built prior to January 1, 1950 demonstrate full compliance with the requirements of the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) Lead Poisoning Prevention Program when issuing a Rental Facility License. <br /><br />The Rental Facility License Application for all rental types now requires acknowledgement of the date built. If the property was built before January 1, 1950, proof of current registration with the MDE Lead Poisoning Prevention Program; and proof that an accredited inspector has certified that the property meets one of the required inspection standards (lead-free certificate, limited lead-free certificate, or a full risk reduction certificate) must be submitted.<br /><br />For further information regarding the Maryland Department of the Environment’s Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, contact the MDE at 1-800-776-2706 or visit the MDE website at www.MDE.state.md.us.<br />Are there penalties for failure to obtain a License?<br /><br />Any person who operates a rental property without first having obtained a License is subject to a class A violation and may have to pay civil fines as a penalty.<br /><br />For current fee amounts and further information, refer to Frequently Asked Licensing/Registration Questions or contact the Licensing and Registration unit at 240-777-3666.<br /><br />Frequently Asked Licensing/Registration Questions<br /><br />Effective July 1, 2004<br /><br />1. How Much are the License/Registration Fees?<br /><br />Structure Type Annual Fee Per Unit for Each Structure Type<br /><strong>LICENSE FEES</strong><br /><span class=|gq2|style3|gq2|>CLASS I </span>Licenses Apartment Complex $38.00<br />Accessory Apartment $38.00<br />Personal Living Quarters $38.00<br />All Other<br />(includes individually owned Garden Condominium, High-Rise Condominium, and Piggy-Back Units) $56.00<br /><br /><span class=|gq2|style3|gq2|>CLASS II </span>Licenses Single Family Detached House $98.00<br />Townhouse $98.00<br />Duplex $98.00<br />Back to Back Townhouse $98.00<br />Quadraplex $98.00<br /><br /><strong>REGISTRATION FEES</strong><br />Common Ownership Communities Registration Fees All types of units $3.00<br />Registered Living Units No fee<br /><br />2. How often do I have to pay the License/registration fee?<br /><br />The License/registration year period follows the county's fiscal year--July 1st through June 30th of each year. The full fee is due for any unit that is rented for any portion of the fiscal year.<br /><br />3. How do I know when the License/registration fee is due?<br /><br />Invoices are automatically issued each year. Payment is due within 30 days upon receipt.<br /><br />4. Who do I make my check payable to?<br /><br />Montgomery County, MD.<br /><br />5. When will I receive my License?<br /><br />License Certificates are only issued to landlords of apartment complexes (because the certificate must be posted). For all others, the canceled check acts as confirmation that the application has been processed. Anyone needing confirmation or written proof of licensing status may contact the licensing unit directly by calling 240-777-3666.<br /><br />6. Who must complete the License application form?<br /><br />Anyone may complete the form, but the owner must sign the completed application.<br /><br />7. What are the penalties for failing to License/register?<br /><br />Failure to License/register is a Class A Violation of the Montgomery County Code and violators may be issued a civil citation for $500 for the initial offense, and $750 for repeat offenses.<br /><br />8. Do I have to hire an agent or management company to handle my rental property?<br /><br />No, however rental property owners who live outside the state of Maryland must designate an |gq2|agent for service of process|gq2| (also called a |gq2|legal agent|gq2|). The legal agent must live in Maryland and agree to accept legal documents on behalf of the out-of-state owner. A legal agent may be a friend or family member, they do not have to be a professional management agent. Even owners living in nearby Washington, D.C. or Virginia must assign legal agents.<br /><br />9. What do I do if I sell my rental property? Do I get a refund of the License fee?<br /><br />Notify the Licensing/Registration Unit by sending in a short note which includes the following information:<br /><br />- License number<br /><br />- Address of the rental property<br /><br />- Date of the sale<br /><br />- New owner's name &amp; address<br /><br />No refund will be issued if the property was rented during any portion of the License year.<br /><br />10. What does Montgomery County use the License/Registration Fees to pay for?<br /><br />License fees are used to support the landlord-tenant dispute resolution process as well as code enforcement activities.<br /><br />Common ownership community registration fees are used to support the common ownership communities dispute resolution process.<br /><br />11. Do the licensing laws apply in all areas of Montgomery County?<br /><br />No. Rental properties located within the city limits of certain incorporated municipalities may need to be licensed by the respective city governments, such as City of Rockville and the City of Gaithersburg. A phone call to the License and Registration unit will confirm whether licensing/registration is required. Our phone number is 240-777-3666.<br /><br />12. Are any units exempt from the licensing requirements?<br /><br />Yes - there are two types of exemptions:<br /><br />Owner Occupied: A unit may be exempt if someone who is a partial owner lives in the unit - caller should contact the licensing unit for details.<br /><br />Relative Occupied: A unit may be exempt if it is occupied by a relative of the owner. The term |gq2|relative|gq2| means:<br /><br />The landlord's siblings, parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren, and their spouses; and<br /><br />The landlord's spouse and the spouse's siblings, parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren, and their spouses.<br /><br />13. Are there special licensing requirements for Accessory Apartments?<br /><br />There is a separate application process for accessory apartments, commonly referred to as |gq2|mother-in-law|gq2| apartments. These units may only be located in owner-occupied single family detached homes and the property owner must be granted a special exception by the Board of Appeals. Any property owner interested in this program should contact the Housing Code Enforcement unit for details at 240-777-3785.<br /><br />14. What are Registered Living Units?<br /><br />Registered Living units are similar to accessory apartments, except that the units are occupied rent-free by either a relative or household employee of the owner occupant.<br /><br />15. What are Personal Living Quarters?<br /><br />The Personal Living Quarters program allows for the existence of affordable individual living units in a multi-use building. A Personal Living Quarters Building is a building containing at least 6 individual living units where the residents may share cooking and sanitation facilities. Personal Living Quarters are allowed as a special exception or a permitted use in all multiple-family residential zones, central business district zones, transit station development area zones, and certain commercial zones.
